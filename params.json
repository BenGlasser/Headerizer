{"name":"Headerizer","tagline":"a utility for inserting a header into multiple files","body":"Headerizer\r\n==========\r\nCopyright Â© 2012 Ben Glasser\r\n\r\nHeaderizer is a utility that (when finished) will recursively sift through sub directories of a specified root inserting a header into files of a specified type.  Headerizer was inspired by @BartMassey [emacs-copyright](https://github.com/BartMassey/emacs-copyright) and is released under a GPLv3.0 license\r\n\r\nCurrent State\r\n-------------\r\nAs of now, Hederizer has been realesed only as a commandline utility and can be used  as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n[-r|--recursive] [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose] <directory> <header> fileType1 fileType2 ... fileTypeN\r\n\r\n  [-r|--recursive]\r\n        tell Headerizer whether or not to recursively search subdirectories for\r\n        matching files\r\n\r\n  [-h|--help]\r\n        displays this message\r\n\r\n  [-v|--verbose]\r\n        Requests verbose output\r\n\r\n  <directory>\r\n        Name of directory or file which is to be Headerized (default: ./)\r\n\r\n  <header>\r\n        This is the intended header to be inserted into the specified files\r\n        (default: //  Default Header)\r\n\r\n  fileType1 fileType2 ... fileTypeN\r\n        file extensions of files which are to be Headerized (default: txt)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe jar for this project can be found under [Downloads](https://github.com/BenGlasser/Headerizer/downloads)\r\n\r\nnote that there is little to no error handleing/fault tolerance right now so this may blow up in your face, but it hasn't lost a file yet ;)\r\n\r\nCurrently, Headerizer works by prepending the specified header at the begining of the specified file.  if the -r option is invoked and a directory is passed as an argument it will prepend the header to all files of the specified file type found in that directory and all sub directories.\r\n\r\nFuture Plans\r\n------------\r\nSo far no future releases have been formalized, but it is my intention to incorporate the following features into Headerizer as the projects develops\r\n\r\n*    GUI \r\n*    Insert headers into multiple file types at once\r\n*    Automatic comment prefixing based on file type\r\n*    Automatic name, date, and copyright entry\r\n*    Support for multiple projects across a disjoint directory structure\r\n\r\nany other ideas? you are welcome pass them along or implement them as you see fit.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
